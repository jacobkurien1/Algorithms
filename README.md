# Algorithms
This repo has all the algorithms that can help you to prepare for a coding interview

The Projects are organized in different folder:
1. Arrays
2. BackTracking
3. Bit Algorithms
4. Disjoint Sets
5. Distributed Algorithms
6. Dynamic Programming
7. Geometry
8. Graphs
9. Greedy Algorithms
10. Heeps
11. Linked List
12. Math Problems
13. Matrix Problems
14. Misc
15. Permutation and Combination
16. Properties
17. Randomized Algo
18. Recursion
19. Search
20. Sorting
21. Stacks and Queues
22. String problems
23. Trees
24. Trie

Open the project in Visual Studio or your favourite IDE (VS Code) and run the file program.cs.
program.cs file will have all the Testcases to test each algorithm.
The test cases are not exhaustive and I would like to encourage the community to add more algorithms and test cases.

Also if you find any bugs with the implementation, feel free to send a pull request.

Pull request is encouraged for:
* Any bugs
* Optimizations
* Additional test cases
